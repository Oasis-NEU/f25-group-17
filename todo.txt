make way of finding and storing information about when rooms are free to use...
current planned process for finding room availability time:

0000, (...[starttime, endtime])*, 2359 as list, sorted in order by starttime
re group into
[0000, starttime[0]], [endtime[0], starttime[1]], ... , [endtime[n], 2359]

checking for overlap/back-to-back threshold:
with threshold = 15 min
if starttime[n+1] - endtime[n] < {threshold}, instead of [endtime[n], starttime[n+1]], use [endtime[n-1], starttime[n+2]]

each room will be an object with time (un/)availability field(s) based on above approach



make system for student-reported time for when room door locks
